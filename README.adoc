= CloudBees action: Copy a remote image with Crane

Use this action to copy a remote image from a source to a destination with Crane, a tool for managing container images. You can also use Crane as a Docker image.

== Prerequisites

Before invoking the action, you must have a Docker config file in the `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` path. This file is used to authenticate with the Docker registry.

Use xref:credentials:configure-oci-credentials.adoc[the OCI credentials configuration action] to generate a Docker config file, as in the following example.

In your YAML file, add:

[source,yaml]
----

      - id: dockerconfig
        name: Configure container registry credentials
        uses: cloudbees-io/configure-oci-credentials@v1
        with:
          registry: ${{ vars.STAGING_DOCKER_REGISTRY }}
          username: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

----

The Docker config file must be formatted in JSON, as follows:

[source,json,role="novalidate"]
----
{
	"auths": {
		"<registry host>": {
			"username": "<username>",
			"password": "<password>",
			"auth": "<username>:<password>"
		}
	}
}
----

NOTE: The `+"auth":"<username>:<password>"+` field must be base64-encoded.
