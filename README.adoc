== Cloudbees action for copying a remote image from a source to a destination using crane

This action can be used to copy a remote image from a source to a destination using link:https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md[crane] .

=== Prerequisites

Before invoking the action, make sure to have the docker config JSON file in the `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` path. This file is used to authenticate with the docker registry.

The format of this JSON file is:

`{"auths":{"<registry host>":{"username":"<username>","password":"<password>","auth":"<username>:<password>"}}}` 

where the `auth` field is base64 encoded.

If your source and destination registries are different, then you need to include the credential for both registries in the config file.

The format of the JSON file in that case would be:

`{"auths": {
        "<source registry>": {
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "auth": "<username>:<password>"
        },
        "<destination registry>": {
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "auth": "<username>:<password>"
        }
    }
}`
